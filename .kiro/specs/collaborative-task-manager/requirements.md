# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-Time Collaborative Task Manager is a full-featured task management application that demonstrates advanced React, Next.js, and MERN stack capabilities. The system enables multiple users to create, assign, and update tasks in real-time with server-side rendering, authentication, and live collaboration features. This project showcases modern web development practices including SSG/SSR, real-time updates, advanced UI patterns, and production-ready DevOps workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Server-Side Rendering & Static Generation

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to access a fast-loading public landing page and authenticated dashboard, so that I experience optimal performance and SEO benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL serve a statically generated page with marketing content
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL server-side render the page with their project list
3. WHEN pages are rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize for SEO and performance metrics

### Requirement 2: Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication with role-based access control, so that I can safely access my projects and manage team permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers or logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate via NextAuth.js with email/password or OAuth
2. WHEN a user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication using Next.js middleware
3. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce admin vs user permissions on API routes
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate authentication pages

### Requirement 3: Project and Task Management

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create and manage projects with tasks, so that I can organize work and track progress efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL store it in MongoDB with proper schema validation
2. WHEN a user performs CRUD operations on tasks THEN the system SHALL process them via Next.js API Routes
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL use React Query for caching and optimistic updates
4. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across all operations

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see task changes instantly when other users make updates, so that I can collaborate effectively in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates a task THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes via Socket.io to all connected clients
2. WHEN multiple users view the same project THEN the system SHALL synchronize task states in real-time
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection and state synchronization gracefully
4. WHEN real-time events are received THEN the system SHALL update the UI without full page refreshes

### Requirement 5: Advanced User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with responsive design, so that I can manage tasks efficiently across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the task board THEN the system SHALL provide Kanban-style drag-and-drop functionality
2. WHEN tasks are moved between columns THEN the system SHALL update their status and persist changes
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL manage global state via Context or Redux Toolkit
4. WHEN UI components render THEN the system SHALL be responsive and accessible across devices

### Requirement 6: Data Storage & Schema Design

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient data storage with proper indexing, so that the application performs well at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL use MongoDB with Mongoose schemas for Users, Projects, Tasks, and ActivityLogs
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL utilize indexes on task status and project IDs
3. WHEN data relationships are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with proper validation

### Requirement 7: Testing & Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and code quality standards, so that the application is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are developed THEN the system SHALL include Jest and React Testing Library tests
2. WHEN API routes are created THEN the system SHALL include Supertest integration tests
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL enforce ESLint and Prettier standards
4. WHEN quality gates are evaluated THEN the system SHALL meet SonarQube quality standards

### Requirement 8: DevOps & Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines with containerization, so that deployments are reliable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for frontend and backend
2. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL trigger GitHub Actions pipeline with lint, test, build, and deploy stages
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL deploy frontend to Vercel and backend to Heroku
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL include health checks and environment variable management
5. WHEN containers are built THEN the system SHALL push images to Docker Hub for distribution
