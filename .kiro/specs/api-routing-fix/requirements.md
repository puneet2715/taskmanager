# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The task manager application is experiencing critical API routing and WebSocket connectivity issues that prevent core functionality like user signup and real-time features from working. The current 2-host setup with Nginx Proxy Manager is not correctly routing API requests to the backend service, and WebSocket connections are failing. This feature addresses the systematic resolution of these infrastructure and routing problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account, so that I can access the task management application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the signup form THEN the request SHALL be routed to the correct backend API endpoint
2. WHEN the backend receives a signup request THEN it SHALL process the request and return appropriate responses
3. IF the API routing is misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
4. WHEN testing the signup endpoint directly THEN it SHALL return validation errors (not 404 responses)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates in the task board, so that I can see changes made by other team members immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend attempts to connect to WebSocket THEN the connection SHALL be successfully established
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are made THEN they SHALL be properly routed through the proxy to the backend
3. IF WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and clear error reporting
4. WHEN multiple users are active THEN real-time updates SHALL be delivered to all connected clients

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent environment configuration across all services, so that the application runs reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN all services SHALL have access to the correct configuration values
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all required environment variables SHALL be present and valid
3. IF environment configuration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN the environment configuration SHALL be consistent across all containers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API health checks and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve service issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the health check endpoint THEN it SHALL return a proper JSON response with service status
2. WHEN the backend service is running THEN the health endpoint SHALL be accessible through the proxy
3. IF services are down THEN health checks SHALL clearly indicate which components are failing
4. WHEN debugging connectivity issues THEN diagnostic endpoints SHALL provide useful information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper proxy configuration for the 2-host setup, so that all API requests and WebSocket connections are correctly routed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made to `api.taskmanager.shadowdragon.dev` THEN they SHALL be routed to the backend service
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are initiated THEN they SHALL be properly upgraded and routed
3. IF proxy configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide clear routing error messages
4. WHEN testing different endpoints THEN each SHALL respond from the correct service (frontend vs backend)
