# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a logout button to the dashboard page to allow users to easily sign out of their session. Currently, the dashboard page doesn't have a visible logout option, requiring users to navigate elsewhere or manually clear their session. This enhancement will improve user experience by providing a clear and accessible way to log out directly from the dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user viewing the dashboard, I want to see a logout button, so that I can easily sign out of my session without navigating to other pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the dashboard page THEN the system SHALL display a logout button in a prominent location
2. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL immediately sign out the user
3. WHEN a user is signed out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the sign-in page
4. WHEN the logout process completes THEN the system SHALL clear all session data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logout button to be visually consistent with the existing dashboard design, so that it feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with other dashboard buttons
2. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors and typography matching the dashboard theme
3. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN the system SHALL include an appropriate icon to make its purpose clear
4. WHEN the logout button is hovered THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback consistent with other interactive elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logout functionality to work reliably, so that I can trust that my session is properly terminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL call the NextAuth signOut function
2. WHEN the signOut function is called THEN the system SHALL use the redirect: false option to prevent automatic redirection
3. WHEN signOut completes THEN the system SHALL manually redirect to the sign-in page using Next.js router
4. IF the logout process fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logout button to be accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities or the device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logout button is rendered THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels for screen readers
2. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL allow the logout button to be focused and activated
3. WHEN the logout button is focused THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure the logout button is appropriately sized for touch interaction
