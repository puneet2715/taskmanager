# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a new Nuxt.js frontend application in a separate `nuxt-FE` folder that replicates all the functionality currently implemented in the existing Next.js frontend. The goal is to provide an alternative frontend implementation using Nuxt.js while maintaining feature parity with the current React/Next.js application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a Nuxt.js version of the frontend application, so that I can leverage Vue.js ecosystem and Nuxt.js features while maintaining the same functionality as the current Next.js application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Nuxt.js application is created THEN it SHALL be located in a `nuxt-FE` directory at the project root
2. WHEN the Nuxt.js application is built THEN it SHALL include all pages and routes equivalent to the Next.js version
3. WHEN the Nuxt.js application runs THEN it SHALL connect to the same backend API endpoints as the Next.js version
4. WHEN the Nuxt.js application is accessed THEN it SHALL provide the same user interface and user experience as the Next.js version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and manage my session in the Nuxt.js application, so that I can securely access protected features just like in the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the authentication pages THEN the system SHALL provide sign-in and sign-up functionality
2. WHEN a user authenticates successfully THEN the system SHALL store and manage their session
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide OAuth integration equivalent to the Next.js version
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the dashboard and project management features in the Nuxt.js application, so that I can manage my projects and tasks with the same functionality as the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their projects and relevant information
2. WHEN a user navigates to project details THEN the system SHALL show project-specific information and tasks
3. WHEN a user interacts with the project board THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop task management
4. WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes projects THEN the system SHALL persist changes through the backend API
5. WHEN a user manages project members THEN the system SHALL provide add/remove member functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage tasks within projects in the Nuxt.js application, so that I can organize and track work progress with the same capabilities as the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views tasks THEN the system SHALL display them in appropriate columns (todo, in-progress, done)
2. WHEN a user drags and drops tasks THEN the system SHALL update task status and persist changes
3. WHEN a user creates or edits tasks THEN the system SHALL provide modal interfaces for task management
4. WHEN a user assigns tasks to team members THEN the system SHALL update task assignments
5. WHEN task updates occur THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time through WebSocket connections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates and user presence in the Nuxt.js application, so that I can collaborate effectively with the same real-time features as the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users are online THEN the system SHALL display user presence indicators
2. WHEN tasks or projects are updated by other users THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time
3. WHEN the connection status changes THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connection indicators
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time synchronization
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access admin functionality in the Nuxt.js application, so that I can manage users and system settings with the same administrative capabilities as the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses admin routes THEN the system SHALL provide administrative interfaces
2. WHEN an admin manages users THEN the system SHALL provide user management functionality
3. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization
4. WHEN admin actions are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails and logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Nuxt.js application to have proper error handling and testing, so that it maintains the same reliability and code quality standards as the Next.js version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error boundaries and fallbacks
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN the application is tested THEN it SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL pass all linting and type checking requirements
5. WHEN the application runs in different environments THEN it SHALL handle environment-specific configurations properly
