# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical authentication issue where OAuth logins (GitHub and Google) result in 401 errors when accessing protected API endpoints, while credential-based logins work correctly. The root cause is that OAuth users are not receiving JWT tokens from the backend, causing the NextAuth session to lack the necessary access token for API authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user signing in with GitHub or Google OAuth, I want to be able to access protected API endpoints after authentication, so that I can use the application's features without encountering 401 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes OAuth authentication with GitHub or Google THEN the backend SHALL generate and return a JWT token for the user
2. WHEN the NextAuth JWT callback processes OAuth authentication THEN it SHALL store the backend JWT token in the session
3. WHEN authenticated OAuth users make API requests THEN the requests SHALL include valid authorization headers
4. WHEN the backend receives API requests from OAuth users THEN it SHALL successfully validate the JWT tokens and authorize the requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want OAuth and credential authentication to follow the same token-based flow, so that both authentication methods work consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth users are created or authenticated THEN the backend SHALL return the same token structure as credential authentication
2. WHEN NextAuth processes any authentication method THEN it SHALL store tokens in the session using the same format
3. WHEN API routes validate authentication THEN they SHALL use the same validation logic for both OAuth and credential users
4. WHEN users switch between authentication methods THEN the application behavior SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for OAuth authentication failures, so that I can troubleshoot authentication issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth token generation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN NextAuth JWT callback encounters errors THEN it SHALL log the error and continue gracefully
3. WHEN API routes detect missing access tokens THEN they SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN OAuth authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL log successful authentication events
