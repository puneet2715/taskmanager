# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds AI-powered capabilities to the collaborative task management system using Google's Gemini API. The system will provide intelligent task summarization and question-answering functionality to enhance user productivity and project understanding.

## Glossary

- **Task_Management_System**: The existing collaborative task management application
- **Gemini_API**: Google's Generative AI API service for natural language processing
- **AI_Service**: The backend service component that interfaces with Gemini API
- **Task_Summary**: An AI-generated condensed overview of all tasks within a project
- **AI_Response**: Generated answer to user questions about specific tasks or projects
- **User**: Any authenticated person using the task management system
- **Project**: A collection of related tasks organized together
- **Task_Card**: Individual task item within a project

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to get an AI-generated summary of all tasks in my current project, so that I can quickly understand the project status and progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User requests a project summary, THE Task_Management_System SHALL generate a comprehensive summary using the Gemini_API
2. THE Task_Management_System SHALL include task statuses, priorities, and key details in the summary
3. THE Task_Management_System SHALL display the AI_Response within 10 seconds of the request
4. THE Task_Management_System SHALL handle projects with up to 100 tasks in a single summary request
5. IF the Gemini_API is unavailable, THEN THE Task_Management_System SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to ask questions about specific task cards and get AI-powered responses, so that I can better understand task requirements and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User selects a Task_Card and asks a question, THE Task_Management_System SHALL send the question and task context to the Gemini_API
2. THE Task_Management_System SHALL provide relevant answers based on task details, description, and project context
3. THE Task_Management_System SHALL respond to questions within 8 seconds
4. THE Task_Management_System SHALL maintain conversation history for follow-up questions within the same session
5. THE Task_Management_System SHALL support questions in natural language format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI integration to be securely configured with proper API key management, so that the system maintains security standards while providing AI features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Task_Management_System SHALL store the Gemini API key securely using environment variables
2. THE Task_Management_System SHALL validate API credentials before processing AI requests
3. THE Task_Management_System SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
4. THE Task_Management_System SHALL log AI service usage for monitoring purposes
5. IF API quota is exceeded, THEN THE Task_Management_System SHALL queue requests and notify users of delays

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI features to be easily accessible from the task interface, so that I can use them without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Task_Management_System SHALL provide a summary button accessible from the project dashboard
2. THE Task_Management_System SHALL include an AI question interface within the Task_Card modal
3. THE Task_Management_System SHALL display AI responses in a clear, readable format
4. THE Task_Management_System SHALL allow users to copy AI responses to clipboard
5. THE Task_Management_System SHALL show loading indicators during AI processing
