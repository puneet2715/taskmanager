# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The active user count displayed on project details pages is not accurate after implementing the fix for rapid connect/disconnect issues. Users are experiencing incorrect counts that don't reflect the actual number of active users in a project, which affects collaboration awareness and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want to see an accurate count of active users in the project, so that I know who is currently working on the project with me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins a project THEN the active user count SHALL increment by 1 for all users in that project
2. WHEN a user leaves a project THEN the active user count SHALL decrement by 1 for all users in that project
3. WHEN a user has multiple browser tabs/connections to the same project THEN they SHALL only be counted once in the active user count
4. WHEN a user's connection is lost and reconnected THEN the active user count SHALL remain accurate without duplicates
5. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the active user count SHALL display the correct number of currently connected users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want the active user count to update in real-time, so that I can see when teammates join or leave the project immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user joins the project THEN I SHALL see the user count update within 1 second
2. WHEN another user leaves the project THEN I SHALL see the user count update within 1 second
3. WHEN I join a project THEN other users SHALL see the count update to include me
4. WHEN I leave a project THEN other users SHALL see the count update to exclude me

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want the active user count to be consistent across all users, so that everyone sees the same information about project activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users are viewing the same project THEN they SHALL all see the same active user count
2. WHEN a user joins or leaves THEN all remaining users SHALL see the same updated count
3. WHEN there are network issues or reconnections THEN the count SHALL eventually converge to the correct value for all users
4. WHEN the system recovers from rapid connect/disconnect scenarios THEN the final user count SHALL be accurate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for user presence tracking, so that temporary network issues don't permanently break the active user count.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a socket connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the user removal from active count
2. WHEN a user reconnects after a network issue THEN they SHALL not be double-counted in the active users
3. WHEN there are rapid connect/disconnect events THEN the final state SHALL be consistent and accurate
4. WHEN socket events are lost or delayed THEN the system SHALL have mechanisms to recover the correct state
