# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance backend socket server user tracking
  - Implement connection counting per user per project instead of simple Set tracking
  - Add socket ID to user/project mapping for proper cleanup
  - Implement event deduplication logic to prevent duplicate join/leave events
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Create user presence service
  - Create dedicated UserPresenceService class for managing user presence state
  - Implement methods for getting accurate user counts per project
  - Add cleanup mechanisms for orphaned user records and stale connections
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Add user presence state synchronization endpoint

  - Create REST endpoint to get current active users for a project
  - Implement validation logic to ensure data consistency
  - Add proper error handling for invalid project IDs
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Enhance frontend useSocket hook state management




  - Implement more robust connectedUsers state management with deduplication
  - Add periodic synchronization with backend user presence state
  - Implement proper cleanup and error handling for state drift scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Add user presence validation and recovery mechanisms
  - Implement state drift detection between frontend and backend
  - Add automatic correction mechanisms when inconsistencies are detected
  - Implement retry logic for failed synchronization attempts
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Update socket event handlers for better reliability
  - Enhance userJoined and userLeft event handlers with deduplication
  - Implement proper event ordering and state validation
  - Add logging for debugging user presence issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive test suite for user presence
  - Write unit tests for enhanced socket server user tracking logic
  - Create integration tests for multi-user scenarios and rapid connect/disconnect
  - Add tests for state synchronization and error recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Add performance monitoring and cleanup mechanisms
  - Implement periodic cleanup of stale user presence records
  - Add performance monitoring for user presence operations
  - Optimize user presence queries for better scalability
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_
