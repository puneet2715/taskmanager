# Drag-and-Drop Implementation Summary

## Task 7.2: Handle drag-and-drop state updates

This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced drag-and-drop functionality for the collaborative task manager.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced useMoveTask Hook
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implemented sophisticated optimistic updates that handle position recalculation for both same-column and cross-column moves
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with specific error messages for different failure scenarios (network, permission, not found)
- **Rollback Functionality**: Automatic rollback of optimistic updates when API calls fail
- **Position Management**: Intelligent position recalculation for affected tasks when moving between columns or reordering within columns

### 2. Improved ProjectBoard Component
- **Drag State Management**: Added `isDragInProgress` state to provide visual feedback during drag operations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error logging and user feedback for failed move operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Added visual indicators during drag operations (select-none class, pointer events disabled)

### 3. Enhanced TaskColumn Component
- **Drag Progress Indication**: Added `isDragInProgress` prop to disable interactions during drag operations
- **Visual States**: Enhanced visual feedback for drop zones and drag states

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive tests for the useMoveTask hook covering all scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Enhanced drag-and-drop integration tests
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests for various error conditions and rollback scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### Optimistic Updates Algorithm
The implementation includes sophisticated optimistic updates that:
1. Calculate new positions for the moved task
2. Adjust positions of affected tasks in both source and destination columns
3. Handle both cross-column moves and same-column reordering
4. Provide immediate UI feedback while API call is in progress

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Specific messaging for connectivity issues
- **Permission Errors**: Clear feedback for authorization failures
- **Not Found Errors**: Handling for tasks that may have been deleted by other users
- **Automatic Rollback**: Complete state restoration on any error

### Performance Optimizations
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Optimistic updates only affect necessary components
- **Efficient Position Calculation**: Smart algorithms to minimize position updates
- **Caching Strategy**: Proper cache invalidation and updates

## API Integration

The implementation works with the existing backend API:
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/move` endpoint for moving tasks
- Proper request/response handling with error states
- Integration with React Query for caching and state management

## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see changes instantly due to optimistic updates
2. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and automatic rollback on failures
3. **Visual Indicators**: Drag states are clearly communicated through UI changes
4. **Smooth Interactions**: Disabled interactions during drag operations prevent conflicts

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes tests for:
- Successful move operations
- Error scenarios and rollback
- Optimistic update behavior
- Position calculation logic
- Cross-column and same-column moves
- Edge cases and error conditions
